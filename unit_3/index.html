		<h3>Bean Dreams brings the in-store coffee tasting experience to your home.</h3>
		<br>
			<p>Try samples of coffee beans before you buy a full-size bag.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Support coffee startups from across the country (and maybe even find your new favorite roastery!)</p>
			<br>
			<p>Feel good about buying fair-trade, always.</p>
			<br><br><br>

		<h3>How it works</h3>
		<br>
		<p>
			<ol>
				<li>First, complete a short flavor profile. We'll get a sense for what you like based on what you've bought before</li>
				<br>
				<li> Second, we send you 4oz. sample bags of coffee beans, based on your flavor profile.</li>
				<br>
				<li>Then, opt in or out to order the beans we sent you. If you're not ready to buy, we'll send you more samples.</li>
			</ol>
