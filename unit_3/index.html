		<h3>How it works</h3>
		<br>
		<p>
			First, complete a short flavor profile. We'll get a sense for what you like based on what you've bought before
			<br>
			Second, we send you 4oz. sample bags of coffee beans, based on your flavor profile.
			<br>
			Then, opt in or out to order the beans we sent you. If you're not ready to buy, we'll send you more samples.
